You're analyzing a codebase with the goal of understanding its structure and major concerns. The tech stack is summarized in ./{output-folder}/1-techstack.md. Categorized files are listed in ./{output-folder}/2-file-categorization.json.

> This task may take some time — that is expected and acceptable.
> Do **not** skip files or produce partial results due to time or complexity. Accuracy and completeness are **mission-critical**.
> You are permitted to take as long as necessary to:
>
> - Review every relevant file
> - Extract actual patterns and conventions
> - Produce complete, high-fidelity output
>   If a file is listed in ./{output-folder}/2-file-categorization.json or is part of a relevant domain, it **must** be included in your analysis.
>   Do not optimize for speed or brevity. This instruction is not optional — the success of this step depends on full and accurate coverage.

Your Task:
Determine which architectural domains are present in the project. Consider:

- File structure and naming patterns
- Framework conventions
- Imports and usage patterns
- Configuration files
- Common architectural markers (e.g., components/, routes/, handlers/, services/, cli/, etc.)

**Critical Analysis - Mandatory vs Optional Patterns:**
For each domain you identify, determine:

- **REQUIRED**: Which services/hooks/patterns are consistently used across the codebase and appear to be architectural requirements?
- **CONSTRAINTS**: What types of implementations are clearly expected? (e.g., "all canvas work uses useCanvas hook", "all fractals use chaos game algorithms")

Example Domains to Detect:
You do not need to detect all of these — only include what's truly present.
There may also be domains that aren't listed here but are relevant to this specific project. Include any meaningful domains you identify.

Examples:

- ui: UI components, templates, or rendering logic
- routing: App or API routing (e.g., Next.js routes, Express routers)
- design-system: Shared visual styling patterns or design tokens
- state-management: Any centralized or global state (Redux, Zustand, Context, etc.)
- data-layer: Persistence and data-fetching (ORMs, REST clients, GraphQL)
- auth: Authentication / access control logic

Output:
Write a JSON object to ./{output-folder}/3-architectural-domains.json like so:

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "required_patterns": {
      "canvas-rendering": "use useCanvas",
      "mathematical-computing": "..."
    },
    "architectural_constraints": {
      "canvas-rendering": "...",
      "mathematical-computing": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

Only include domains you find concrete evidence for based on the actual codebase.

This analysis will help ensure future additions follow the established architectural patterns rather than introducing inconsistent approaches.

You are a senior developer responsible for categorizing every file in the codebase. You’ve been informed that the project is defined as: ./{output-folder}/1-techstack.md (read this file first)

After writing ./{output-folder}/3-file-categorization.json, read the contents of [./4-domain-deep-dive.md](./4-domain-deep-dive.md) and proceed accordingly with {output-folder} as the `output-folder`.
